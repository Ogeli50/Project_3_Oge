# Flu Forecast: Your Road Trip Health Companion
## Project 3

Hitting the road for some summer fun? ☀️ Don't let the flu put a damper on your adventures!  This Flu Forecast dashboard is here to help you steer clear of areas with high flu activity and ensure a smoother, healthier trip.

## Why Flu Forecast?

Vacation season and flu season often go hand in hand. But that doesn't mean you have to ditch your travel plans! Flu Forecast, powered by data from the CDC's FluView, gives you the intel you need to make informed decisions.  

With this interactive dashboard, you can:

* See the Big Picture: Get a quick overview of flu activity across the U.S. with our interactive map. Think of it as your personal flu hotspot tracker! ️
* Dive Deeper: Want to know how things are shaping up in a specific state? Select a state from the dropdown menu and get state-specific details.
* Travel Through Time (Sort of): Curious about historical flu trends? No problem! Choose a date range to see how flu activity has changed over time. ⏱️
* Strain Analysis: Different flu strains? No worries! We'll break down the case counts by strain so you can stay informed.

## Built for the Modern Traveler

Flu Forecast is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. It's like having a travel advisor khusus (especially) for flu prevention!  

Here's what makes it tick:

* Map It Out: Our interactive map lets you visualize flu activity across the U.S. at a glance. No need to decipher confusing charts! ️
* Time Machine: Want to see how things have changed? Hop in our time machine (well, the date range filter) and explore historical flu data. ⏱️
* See It Your Way: Focus on specific states or timeframes using the dropdown menus and filters. It's all about customization!
* Clear and Crisp: Easy-to-understand charts from Plotly make flu trends crystal clear. No squinting required!

Wondering what makes Flu Forecast tick? 

Here's a peek behind the curtain:

* Techie Team: This project is a collaborative effort between Joy Ragland, Ogechukwu Tasie, and Kiana Rich. We're all passionate about using data for good! ‍‍
* Python Power: Pandas, Flask, and SQLAlchemy form the backbone of our backend, ensuring data wrangling and serving happen smoothly.
* JavaScript Junction: Plotly and Leaflet bring the data to life on the frontend, creating the interactive map and charts you see.
* Data Matters: We take data accuracy seriously. That's why we source our data directly from the CDC's FluView.

## Ethical Considerations

We take data privacy and responsible use seriously:

* Trustworthy Data: Our data comes straight from the CDC, so you can be confident it's reliable and up-to-date. ☑️
* Privacy First: We don't collect or store any personal information while you use Flu Forecast. Your privacy is our priority!
* Openness is Key: All the code and methods we use are open-source, so you can see exactly how we handle the data. Transparency is important to us!
